Abstract: As the latest video coding standard, versatile video coding (VVC) has shown its ability in retaining pixel quality. To excavate more compression potential for video conference scenarios under ultra-low bitrate, this paper proposes a bitrate adjustable hybrid compression scheme for face video. This hybrid scheme combines the pixel-level precise recovery capability of traditional coding with the generation capability of deep learning based on abridged information, where Pixel wise Bi-Prediction, Low-Bitrate-FOM and Lossless Keypoint Encoder collaborate to achieve PSNR up to 36.23 dB at a low bitrate of 1.47 KB/s. Without introducing any additional bitrate, our method has a clear advantage over VVC under a completely fair comparative experiment, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. Moreover, our scheme can adapt to any existing encoder / configuration to deal with different encoding requirements, and the bitrate can be dynamically adjusted according to the network condition.
