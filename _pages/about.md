# About

I am currently a Ph.D student in [MediaLab](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn)), supervised by Prof. [Li Song](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/author/li-song/). My interests cover deep learning, computer vision. Currently I mainly work on the areas of generative models, and image/video generation/animation.
